 <h2> Evaluator Participants:</h2> 
Roni is the first evaluator, she is middle aged woman who is a friend of my aunt's. I selected her because she is a mother of a child 
who is in elementary school and has ADHD. He does not have a reading disability, but at times struggles reading class becuase of the 
lengthy time period and in turn sometimes this impacts his skill set and behavior. I believe she would have fallen somewhere within my 
target audience and was an appropriate candidate to evaluate the site. Therefore, it could give me a better indication if my site would be 
benefit students and families that do not specifically relate to the identification of a reading disability as well. She used her Dell CORE i5, 
Windows 7 computer with a Google chrome browser. She was connected to her home high speed internet when completing this evaluation.
    
<p>My next evaluator was Aaron, a neighbor around my age who lives in my apartment complex. He is a little younger than what I pressume most
    of my targeted audience would be and has a good amount of technology experience and background that maybe some of the others evaluating my
    site may not maintain. I felt it would be beneficial to have someone with some other experience and different point of view take a look at
    it as well. He used a Surface Pro i7 processor, GoogleChrome for his browser and was connected to the high speed internet with in his 
    apartment. </p>
   
<p> Lastly, I asked a parent, who's child I had in class previously, to evaluate my site. Her name is Julie and she is a hands on parent, who
    has a basic understanding of her child's reading disability, but still has many questions and concerns regularly and is always searching 
    for new ideas to test at home. I selected Julie because I wanted a prime example of someone from the targeted audience because ultimately
    they were the reason behind my site. I want to know first hand if an active parent who wants to know and try more, found the site, useful,
    appropriate, user-friendly,informative, organized etc. I am really going to take everything she says into serious consideration. Julie used
    an HP Intel UHD with a Windows 10 operating system using internet explorer for her browser and connecting to her at home high speed internet.

 <p>All agreed the navigation was easy and user friendly. They all also felt the information was very organized and easy to navigate to 
     what you were specifically looking for. Also, all rated the design with top marks. The simplicity of the page was commented on by 
     all users. Most liked the color scheme, felt it was engaging without being overwhelming. Though Roni did make a comment regarding
     the headings on the homepage that were in white font with the peach background, stating this could possibly be difficult to read 
     for some. </p>

    <p>Aaron commented on the missing images and suggested tips to try in order to get all of my images to appear. He said he did not see any 
     problems with the code so he was also confused by these errors. Julie also made comments regarding the images they were not showing 
     just stating she would have loved to see the photos of some of the other activities suggested. All recognized my name and contact info 
        on every page, but Roni did have trouble accessing the email link from her computer. </p>
     <p>Roni and Julie both seemed pleased with the site overall and both stated they would reference it in the future with their child. 
     Julie thinks she may print off the. Special Ed Terms, page and keep it with her sons IEP paperwork as a quick reference before and during
     meetings. She also said she already even made a trip to the dollar store in search of some of the suggested supplies that she will use come 
     September when working on skills at home! Julie commented that she wished the final two pages were done, she would have loved to see the student 
     resources for online activities.Roni mentioned something similar in regards to the “Addressing Behavioral and Attention Problems at Home”. </p>

    <p> Based on the evaluation reports from my evaluators and the comments from above, I believe my site does and will, especially after it is complete, 
        address all the use cases in my design document. </p>

  <h2>Recommended/Planned changes to the design:</h2>
  Based on the feedback that I have collected, I propose making changes in the following areas:

 <h3>Improving Design and Navigation</h3> 
  <p>Overall, the evaluators seemed very pleased with the format of my site and found it very use friendly, aside from some minor suggestions
    listed below:</p>
  <p><b>Titling:</b> All of my pages need to be named in the title bar in the browser to help the audience understand where they are 
    in the site at all times. This is something I already went through and revised on my pages after reading the evaluations.</p>
  <p><b>Color Scheme:</b> The majority of the evaluators were pleased with the color scheme and felt it was appealing, but not too busy. 
  Though, one evaluator stated that the headings with white font on the peach background was somewhat difficult to see so I will take
  this into consideration though most liked the scheme.</p>
  <p> <b>Navigation:</b> The third evalutor had some difficulty with my email link and said they it did not work successfully for them. 
      I will take a look at my code for my link again and test it in all three of the browsers on my computer to see if I notice anything. </p>
    <p><b>Media</b> Two out of three evaluators commented on the image problem, with only a few of the images showing up.I will need to
        really take time and look into what is going on here. I have reviewed it multiple times, but maybe I just need to re-code all of
        the images that are not successfully working. Aaron made comments about inputting more media, links etc. Luckily, my fifth 
        page is stil incompplete, which is my Online Student Resource Tab, this will include several links for students to utilize. </p>
   
    <h2>Reflections on your evaluation process:</h2> 
 <p> I was very excited and anxious to see what the three evaluators had to say about my site. I have been investing so much time in it
  because I really do hope there are families out there who will utlize it. These evaluations were a crucial component to helping me
  meet that goal. I was pleased to have Aaron evaluate my site since he understands a little more of the technology side, but I was thrilled
    to find two parents who are potential people in mine targeted audience as well. It was nice to hear some of the things I could add or 
    do differently, but I did have a sigh of relief to know that found it organized, informative and user friendly! That was a big piece of my
    main goal with this site, as many parents need those elements to not feel intimidated or like they are weeding through information without
    getting to the meat and potatoes of what they are truly looking for. I am excited to utlize all of this information to complete my final
     website!</p>
