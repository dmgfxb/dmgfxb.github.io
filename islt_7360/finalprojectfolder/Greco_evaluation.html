 <h2> Evaluator Participants:</h2> 
Roni is the first evaluator, she is middle aged woman who is a friend of my aunt's. I selected her because she is a mother of a child 
who is in elementary school and has ADHD. He does not have a reading disability, but at times struggles reading class becuase of the 
lengthy time period and in turn sometimes this impacts his skill set and behavior. I believe she would have fallen somewhere within my 
target audience and was an appropriate candidate to evaluate the site. Therefore, it could give me a better indication if my site would be 
benefit students and families that do not specifically relate to the identification of a reading disability as well. She used her Dell CORE i5, 
Windows 7 computer with a Google chrome browser. She was connected to her home high speed internet when completing this evaluation.
    
<p>My next evaluator was Aaron, a neighbor around my age who lives in my apartment complex. He is a little younger than what I pressume most
    of my targeted audience would be and has a good amount of technology experience and background that maybe some of the others evaluating my
    site may not maintain. I felt it would be beneficial to have someone with some other experience and different point of view take a look at
    it as well. He used a Surface Pro i7 processor, GoogleChrome for his browser and was connected to the high speed internet with in his 
    apartment. </p>
   
<p> Lastly, I asked a parent, who's child I had in class previously, to evaluate my site. Her name is Julie and she is a hands on parent, who
    has a basic understanding of her child's reading disability, but still has many questions and concerns regularly and is always searching 
    for new ideas to test at home. I selected Julie because I wanted a prime example of someone from the targeted audience because ultimately
    they were the reason behind my site. I want to know first hand if an active parent who wants to know and try more, found the site, useful,
    appropriate, user-friendly,informative, organized etc. I am really going to take everything she says into serious consideration. Julie used
    an HP Intel UHD with a Windows 10 operating system using internet explorer for her browser and connecting to her at home high speed internet.

  <h2>Use Cases:</h2> 
  
  <h2>Recommended/Planned changes to the design:</h2>
  Based on the feedback that I have collected, I propose making changes in the following areas:

 <h3>Improving Design and Navigation</h3> 
  <p>Overall, the evaluators seemed very pleased with the format of my site and found it very use friendly, aside from some minor suggestions
    listed below:</p>
  <p><b>Titling:</b> All of my pages need to be named in the title bar in the browser to help the audience understand where they are 
    in the site at all times. This is something I already went through and revised.</p>
  <p><b>Color Scheme:</b> The majority of the evaluators were pleased with the color scheme and felt it was appealing, but not too busy. 
  Though, one evaluator stated that the headings with white font on the peach background was somewhat difficult to see so I will take
    this into consideration though most liked the scheme.</p>
  <p> <b>Navigation:</b> The third evalutor had some difficulty with my email link and said they it did not work successfully for them. </p>
