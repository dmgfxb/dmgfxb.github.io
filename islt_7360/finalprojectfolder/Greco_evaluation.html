  <h2>Recommended/Planned changes to the design:</h2>
  Based on the feedback that I have collected, I propose making changes in the following areas:

 <h3>Improving Design and Navigation</h3> 
  Overall, the evaluators seemed very pleased with the format of my site and found it very use friendly, aside from some minor suggestions
  listed below:
  <b>Titling:</b> All of my pages need to be named in the title bar in the browser to help the audience understand where they are 
  in the site at all times. This is something I already went through and revised.
  <b>Color Scheme:</b> The majority of the evaluators were pleased with the color scheme and felt it was appealing, but not too busy. 
  Though, one evaluator stated that the headings with white font on the peach background was somewhat difficult to see so I will take
  this into consideration though most liked the scheme. 
  <b>Navigation:</b> The third evalutor had some difficulty with my email link and said they it did not work successfully for them.
