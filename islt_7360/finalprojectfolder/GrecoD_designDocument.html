<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p> Primarily, I want this website to be a resource for parent(s) (guardian) of children who have a learning disability 
in reading or a parent(s) (guardian) of a struggling reader, within the primary grade levels. From my experiences as a Learning Support Teacher,
regardless of the district I am in, I hear and see my parents struggling with the same aspects of this and having the same concerns. For many, most
of the language and terms are unfamiliar and intimidating. Not only that, but they fear for their child's success and often feel as though they are
helpless when it comes to their child's success too. Many feel frustrated at home and give up on working on the academics because they feel this is a losing battle.
I want to provide them with resources to empower them and make them more comfortable and confident in this area and with their child, without overwhelming them with
too much information that they need to weed through. This site will provide them with important terms they should know, ideas/strategies to try and implement, objects
to make learning more fun at home and engaging online resources for reinforcement of skills at home. </p> 

<h2>Audience:</h2>
<p> The target audience for my website will primarily be parents (guardians) of students who are identified with a reading disability within the primary grades. The
site could also be beneficial for parents of a struggling reader or simply parents who need ideas when working on reading skills at home with their child. They can utilize
the website as a resources for themselves in becoming familiar with special education terms and strategies, as well as a resource hub for websites that contain beneficial
activities for their child.

<h2> Interview Questions</h2>
I interview 5 different parents to inquire and determine what key components should be adressed within my website. The parents age group ranged and involved a mix of males (2)
and females (3). Most felt comfortable with going on the internet and looking at websites, but none classified themseleves as very "tech savvy". Below are the questions and answers
from the interview.
<p> <i> What content would you find most useful? </i> </p>
<ul><li>Resources for struggling readers</li>
  <li>Tips and ideas for home practice with specific examples; especially during work refusal</li>
  <li> Suggestions for what we should work on at home</li> 
  <li>More information on an IEP</li>
  </ul>

<p> <i> What kind of resources would you like to see? </i> </p> 
<ul>
<li>Pictures and videos, not just descriptions-I am a visual person</li>
  <li>online reading games that would appeal to first graders</li>
  <li>resource for special education terms and laws</li>
</ul>

<p> <i> Are there any specific special education terms that would you like a better understanding of?</i> </p>
<ul>
  <li>IEP</li>
  <li>SDI</li>
  <li>Learning Support</li>
</ul>
<p> <i> How often do you see yourself utilizing a site like this? </i> </p>
<ul>
  <li>3 Parents said weekly</li>
  <li>2 Parents said monthly</li>
</ul>
<p> <i> Do you believe this site make you feel more confident in regards to special education and working with your child at home? </i> </p>
<ul>
  <li>All parents interviewed said yes!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use Cases:</h2>
<p> <b>Use Case 1: Intial/Annual IEP is approaching </b><br>
Their child's IEP meeting is coming up and the parent does not want to go in without having a basic foundation of the IEP and the vocabulary used within it. They want to be better
prepared so they feel they are an active member of the team. They could go onto the website, click on the Special Education Terms & Resources tab and refresh on the vocabulary used
often throughout the IEP. They may even get some ideas for accommodations and modifications that should be included in their child's IEP, but are not already, just by reading through
the examples listed within the definitions. They also may get some accommodation ideas from the Home Strategies tabs as well.</p>
<p> <b> Use Case 2: Easter/Spring Break is at the end of the week & your child's teacher is not sending homework home </b> <br>
This does give children, especially in the primary grades, a little break from coming home and doing work, but children need consistency and repition to ensure skills are retained
plus it keeps them in a routine. This is all especially important for those students with a disability. Parents can block out a half hour each night and have their child go on and
select a website from the online resource tab and have the child work on a specific skills that they could use some extra remediation with.</p>
<p> <b> Use Case #3: A child is introduced to 5 new sight words each week and this week's words are particularly challenging for them and the parent is stuck on how to help them.
In turn, this is causing many behavioral problems at home and work refusal. </b> <br>
The parent could go onto the website and under the Home Strategies to Address Reading Deficits, look at some of the different activities that could try with the child to assist
them in a fun way (sight word SWAT, Stuck in the Mud etc.)  They then could go to the Home Strategies-Addressing Behavioral/Attention Deficits Tab, to help them both get back on track
and motivate the child to work through practicing those sight words that work by utilizing one of the incentive charts suggestions or tools.</p>


<h2> Five Reference Websites:</h2>
Below is a list of five various websites relating to similar content as my website. Some reference what I believe to be good examples, others refer
to sites that I did not find appealing/ beneficial.
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.rif.org/reading-rockets?gclid=CjwKCAjw9-HZBRAwEiwAGw0QcZFvLLSAwKO3Z1iCxxYhGi2KvBIpB86BRLZHA5XLU7_EiAdh8hhodhoCWhYQAvD_BwE">Reading is Fundamental Tips for Parents & Families</a> 
 I like the layout of the site, the color scheme, the font selection and the flow information. It is appeasing to the ey, but not overwhelming in any way. I used similar ideas with just selecting a few colors for my page and I plain to use similar fonts.</li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/parents/education/reading-language/reading-tips/how-to-create-a-literate-home-first-grader-and-reader-writer/">How to Create A Literate Home</a>
 This site is an example of the overload of information I will not be providing. Each page has a long box of text that you have to continue scrolling to read. This is also taking 
 what I am discussing and broading the spectrum and is going into depth on a larger scale, but i believe there is too much information, too many sub tabs and too much text on one page. </li>
  <li><a href="http://athome.readinghorizons.com/blog">Reading Horizons-At Home Solutions</a> 
  I felt as though this site most embodied the idea of my website and had as similar platform. Providing parents with information, "at home strategies" and activities and printables. </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/parents/books-and-reading/reading-resources/developing-reading-skills/reading-comprehension-and-decoding-strategies.html">Scholastic Reading Strategies for Parents</a>
  This is an example of what my site will not look like in layout or the presentation information. There is way too much text with no break up, no sub heading, is out dated should provide
  parents with some visuals of their ideas and examples. </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.fortheteachers.org/ways-a-parent-can-help-a-child-with-reading/">Ways A Parent Can Help A Child With Reading</a>    
  This is another example of a site where I am not a fan of the layout, everything is centered which leaves the sides looking blank and results in a lot of scrolling. In order for it to
  be more appealing, I think there be should some more color maybe separating the headings or tabs. I do like the banner logo at the top left and will possibly create something similar. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Media: </h2>
This website will include the following: <br>

<b>Videos</b> <br>
  I will include self created Demo's for some of the reading activities and suggested strategies. I will also include Youtube video tutorials and songs to reinforce skills. I will
  be sure to cite any videos used that are not my own. <br>

<b>Images</b> <br>
  All images will be uploaded from my phone from things I have purchased or created in my classroom. <br>
  
<b>Websites</b> <br>
If I include outside resources or websites to share with parents, I will cite the website fully. <br>

 <h2> Color scheme and rationale: </h2>
The color scheme of my page will consist of black, greys, and peachy/pink shades. The reasoning behind this is that those colors are not hard on the eyes, meaning not too bright,
but not too dull either. Therefore, despite the age/ eye sight of the parent I feel as though they would be able to read and find everything. This is also the reason for keeping a
black font throughout. I am a teacher and as much as I love COLOR and lots of it, I feel as though with this site is not appropriate to include too much color or brightness. I
found this color combination basic, but enough pop of color for the headings and tabs. This page is an example of what my color scheme will look like.

  Headers, footers, and navigation bars will be Samoln with black writing
  The main background will be gray with black writing
  Main Headings will be peach with black writing.
