<p>Listed below are two possibilities for topics to include within my final website:</p>
<h2>Topic 1</h2>
<h3>Terms to Know for Parents- <i>specifically of a child w/ a Learning Disability</i></h3>
<br>I have basically determined the general idea of my webpage. Primarily, I want it to be a resource for parents of children who have a learning disability <br>
in reading or a parent of a struggling reader, within the primary grade levels. I believe a crucial component to include would be familiarizing parents with some <br>
of the special education verbage that they will hear or want to use when best addressing their child's needs. Below are just some of the key terms I would include: 
<ol>
    <li><b> Accommodations:</b> are supports and services provided to help a student access the general education curriculum and validly demonstrate learning. <br>
    Some examples of accommodations: extended time on tests, assignments etc., setting of where they may take assessments and preferntial seating, level of support <br>
    and if they need aide assistance, visual schedules, sensory items, sensory breaks, flexible seating or opportunities for movement.</li> 
    <li><b>Inclusion:</b> the belief that people with disabilities should have the same access to services, activities, and opportunities as everyone else. <br>
    For example, people with disabilities learn in regular (not special-needs) classes whenever possible, if their needs can be met and work in places designed <br>
    to accommodate their disability. </li> 
    <li><b>Individualized Education Program (IEP):</b>a written plan that outlines the educational goals and support needed for a student with disabilities. <br>
    The IEP is agreed upon by the student's family, teachers, school administrators, and others who spend time with the student away from school.</li>
    <li><b>Modifications:</b> individualized changes made to the content and performance expectations for students.
    <br>Some examples of Modifications: quantity- modify the number of items that the child is expected to learn or complete, output: how a student responds to <br>
    instruction (could be a different form of an assessment or verbally, on a whiteboard, Ipad etc.)</li> 
</ol>
<h2>Topic 2</h> <h3>Strategies for Motivating A Struggling Learning- <i>specifically during a non-prefered activty</i></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Implent an incentive chart, board, bucket etc; I  will provide some examples that myself and other teachers have used in the past within the link</li>
    <li>Start small, begin with a warm up activity that you know they will succeed in</li>
    <li>Provide immediate feedback with the incentive chart after simple tasks and gradually provide the feedback less quickly while working through the tasks</li>
    <li> Consistently remind them what they are working towards</li>
    <li>Use engaging materials; sometimes simply things like a whiteboard, highlighters, sight word games, fun manipulatives or pointers can make all the difference</li>
</ul>
