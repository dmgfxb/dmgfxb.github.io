    <h2>Resourceful Special Education Terms</h2> <br>
    <b> Accommodations: </b> are supports and services provided to help a student access the general education curriculum and validly demonstrate learning. <br>
<i>Some examples of accommodations:</i> extended time on tests, assignments etc., setting of where they may take assessments and preferntial seating, level of support 
and if they need aide assistance, visual schedules, sensory items, sensory breaks, flexible seating or opportunities for movement.<br>
<p> <b> Extended School Year (ESY: </b> services are designed to support a student with a disability as documented under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to maintain the academic,
social/behavioral, communication, or other skills that they have learned as part of their Individualized Education Program (IEP) or Section 504 accommodation plan. In order for a student to receive ESY services,
the student must have evidenced substantial regression and recoupment issues during the previous IEP year and/or there is evidence of emerging skills which are often referred to as "breakthrough" skills. The focus
of the services provided to the student as part of an ESY program are generally not upon learning new skills or "catching up" to grade level, but rather to provide practice to maintain previously acquired or learned skills. </p> 
<p> <b>Full-time Support:</b> Special education supports and services provided by special education personnel for 80% or more of the school day. </p>
<p> <b>Inclusion: </b> the belief that people with disabilities should have the same access to services, activities, and opportunities as everyone else. <br> 
For example, people with disabilities learn in regular (not special-needs) classes whenever possible, if their needs can be met and work in places designed 
to accommodate their disability. <br> </p> 
<p> <b> Individualized Education Program (IEP): </b> a written plan that outlines the educational goals and support needed for a student with disabilities. <br>
The IEP is agreed upon by the student's family, teachers, school administrators, and others who spend time with the student away from school. </p>
<p> <b> Itinerant Support: </b> Special education supports and services provided by special education personnel for 20% or less of the school day. </p>
<p><b> Modifications: </b> individualized changes made to the content and performance expectations for students. <br>
<i> Some examples of Modifications: </i> quantity- modify the number of items that the child is expected to learn or complete, output: how a student responds to 
instruction (could be a different form of an assessment or verbally, on a whiteboard, Ipad etc. <br> </p>
<p> <b> Present Level of Performance (PLOP): </b> Also known as the PLP, the present level of performance is the portion of your child's IEP that details how he is doing academically at the moment.
An assessment which should be done freshly and thoroughly each year, a PLOP should include a detailed description of your child's current abilities and skills, with attention to his weakness and strengths and how these will affect his education.
<p> <b> Specially designed instruction (SDI): </b> means adapting, as appropriate, to the needs of an eligible child under this part, the content, methodology, or delivery of
instruction to address the unique needs of a child that results from the child's disability; and to ensure access of the child to the general curriculum, so that he or she can
meet the educational standards adopted by the State.
<p> <b> Supplemental Support: </b> Special education supports and services provided by special education personnel for more than 20% but less than 80% of the school day. </p>
