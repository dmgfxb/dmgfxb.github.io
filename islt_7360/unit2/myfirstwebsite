<h1>My H1 is my title</h1>

<p>Hello, Class! My name is Dana. This is block is surrounded by paragraph tags. Paragraphs are a block level element. </p>

<p>However, some tags are inline, meaning that they don't create a new block of text, but they state that there is a meaning change. For example, <b>this text is emphasized by making it bold</b>. Sometimes we may choose to emphasize other text by <i>italicizing it</i> or <u>underlining it</u>.</p>
